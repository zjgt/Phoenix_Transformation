# Phoenix_Transformation
Hi, I'm interested in the synthesis of realistic biological systems, and this repository is dedicated to the training, synthesis, and application of realistic transcriptomes.
This respository heavily borrows, i.e., cloning with a tiny bit of modification, from StyleGAN2-ADA, SRGAN, and pix2pix.
Due to file size limitations, only a small portion of images are included in the training library for SRGAN, StyleGAN-ADA, and pix2pix.
The full training library and saved model for StyleGAN2-ADA can be accessed from my google drive at:

The full training library for SRGABN can be accessed at:

SRGAN is cloned from: https://github.com/Lornatang/SRGAN-PyTorch.

StyleGAN2-ADA is cloned from: https://github.com/dvschultz/stylegan2-ada-pytorch.

pix2pix is cloned from: https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix.
